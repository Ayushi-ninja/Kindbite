# 🍱 Food Donation Dashboard System (Frontend Prototype)

A React-based frontend dashboard system designed to streamline the donation and redistribution of surplus food between donors (like restaurants) and NGOs, with admin oversight and analytics.

This is the frontend module of a larger AI + IoT-powered platform that aims to reduce urban food waste and combat hunger by enabling seamless coordination between food donors and NGOs.
